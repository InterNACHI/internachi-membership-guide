# InterNACHI Membership Guide

InterNACHI® is working on a membership guide that we intend to print and send to members and prospective
members. We’d like to publish a web-based version as well, and this is where we need your help! Our web
design team simply doesn’t have the time to give this project the attention it deserves.

**We need a talented front-end designer to take the project on.**

## Applying for the contract

We've probably already reached out to you if you're seeing this repository. (If not, [please see below](#trial-contract).)
Here are the ways to send in your trial work:

1. Submit a PR of your work directly to this repository
2. Create a public fork of this repository and send us the link
3. Create a private fork of this repository and add [@inxilpro](https://github.com/inxilpro) as a collaborator
4. Clone this repository locally and send us a zipped up version with your changes applied

### Trial contract

We are reaching out to designers and offering them a 2-hour trial contract to submit a small sample via one
of the methods below. If we haven't contacted you directly, you're still welcome to apply, although we recommend
that you [contact Chris Morrell](https://twitter.com/inxilpro) first to discuss your hourly rate and get approved
for a 2-hour trial contract.
