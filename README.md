# InterNACHI Membership Guide

[View the latest version of the guide](https://internachi.github.io/internachi-membership-guide/)

InterNACHI® is working on a membership guide that we intend to print and send to members and prospective
members. We’d like to publish a web-based version as well, and this is where we need your help! Our web
design team simply doesn’t have the time to give this project the attention it deserves.

**We need a talented front-end designer to take the project on.**

## How to Apply

1. First, [take a look at the print version of the guide](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets-east-1.nachi.org/pdf/internachi-catalog-2021-10-15.pdf). 
   We don’t want a pixel-perfect replica, but instead a responsive web-first version that follows the same structure and uses
   most of the same content. There will be places that the web version will diverge from the print version, and there may be sections
   that we remove in favor of linking to existing parts of our website that better convey the information.
2. If you think you’re a good fit, please submit a **tiny PR** to the repository, showing how you would approach a section of the
   catalog. We’re not looking for free/spec work here—it should be just enough to give us a sense of how you'd approach the project
   while not taking you very long to accomplish.
3. We'll get in touch with you once you’ve submitted a PR with next steps.

### Pre-Approval (optional)

If you’re not comfortable submitting a PR out of the blue, open an issue and link to your portfolio or some other existing
work to request pre-approval for one hour of work at your current hourly rate. If we approve, we'll pay you for an hour of
your time to make the first trial PR.

## Why is this a GitHub repo?

It's an experiment. We work with git repositories every day to manage the InterNACHI website. It's a great place to share
and review code. And job applications/portfolio submissions/etc tend to be a terrible way to assess someone’s ability to
actually deliver a great design, so we thought we'd try something new.

We’ll be working out in the open, too, which means that you’ll have a real project that you can point to for future clients.
One with commit history, code review, etc as well as the final product.
